Hello, my name is Ilya Shadrin. I grduated 4 years (WOW!!!) ago from Tomsk State Univercity, Faculty of Informatics. So, i spent a lot of time thinking about the information and the ways internet and devices deals with it.

The project which i developing now is one of my results.

The main idea - is to turn your smartphone into your life recorder. Every sound around will be remembered, nothing will be missed. Imagine that your memory is perfect - you will have all this in your pocket soon!
