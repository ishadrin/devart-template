I'm tired as the devil. Decided to stop writing code today - the head is bad thinking. This means that I had time to write a post. Actually, the preview, which is cuttently available on Google Play, does not embody the idea mentioned in the description - it's free and just keeps last 5 minutes in the RAM buffer. To be honest, I think this app is useless - the reason why i published it is that this summer some guys released similar app on iPhone ("Heard", with 5 minutes buffer in paid version). They have a great marketing company, a lot of installs and promise Android version soon. In fact, I came to my idea about 3 years ago - and it hurt me to know that the similar app was released. So i have to release mine - just to show them that Android is the another world.

I don't really know is it connected with my app, but a lot of monthes where passed and they don't release their Android app yet.

Currently i finishing the UI part of "final" preview - which will be recording as much, as external drive and user will allow.

I planning to make a release tommorow - the dream will come true, rapid development will start.
